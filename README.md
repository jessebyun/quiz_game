<h2>Quiz Game</h2>


In this project, I used a JSON API to generate a URL with a dictionary list of triva questions. This project was written using OOP concept with 2 classes. A question_model class was used to set the attributes of a question list that was made up of a question text and question answer. An object was created using this class to be utilized in a for-loop to append the question-answer pair into a list. A quiz_brain class was also created which would take care of the formating how score was printed onto the consol. This class also handled the formatting of how questions were printed onto the consol and a method to check for correct answers. Program would ask the user True/False questions and provide feedback on whether player answered correctly or not. Score was tracked until user answered all the questions from the question bank.
